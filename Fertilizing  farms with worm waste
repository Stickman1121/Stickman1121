Hello my name is Stephen and I'm looking to learn everything that is expected of o e to get a nft project going I'm new to this all but I'm fast at learning
My idea is a to support  farms,with a 
Nft earthworm 
With this nft will be a unlockable  content
The content will be of q farm to farm for worm waste 
Worm Waste is a great fertilizer, 
After q week of fqrmingbyour earth worms your going to receive  a nft of fertilizer  earthworm waste and sell it on
Nft market
For a price fixed and then split  between the nft hold,farm supported by the nft
The nft holder will then receive another earthworm nft with a unlockabke content
So that  you cam keep farming and the investor/nft holder will have utility  with every sale and buy.
